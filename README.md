# noughts-and-crosses

Noughts and Crosses (or Elephants & Giraffes) in React, we converted this OOP tutorial [this tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) into a React component based game.

There is one small bug that still needs fixing (if someone wins on the last go it says a draw).

Happy Gaming :)

# noughts-and-crosses

*October 2020*

During week 6 of School of Code we were first introduced to React. For our Friday hackathon, we (my partner @FreshtaEbrahim and I) converted this OOP tutorial [this tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) into a React component based Noughts & Crosses game.

### I have updated our project and deployed the game [here](https://elephants-and-giraffes.netlify.app/)

There is one small bug that still needs fixing (if someone wins on the last go it says a draw).

Happy Gaming :)
